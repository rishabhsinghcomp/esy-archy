    This repo contains an org file which can be used to set a arch-hyprland environment based on emacs for better Desktop experience.

 Disclaimer:
 This Desktop Environment is heavily based on emacs and hyprland, so if you are not familiar with emacs,
  then it is recommended to get familiar with emacs and then use this configuration,
 a script is already provided to do the manual work.


 WHY TO USE THIS??
 If you are someone who wants a centralised place to edit all your apps configuration then this method of configuring config files can proove useful to you.
 Like in Windows there is a settings application which can be used to change settings of the system, similarly this config file can be used to create a central place to edit all your configuration.
 It is not only limited to configuration, if you know *org* mode then you can change the way you operate your computer.
 This method can be used to manage your personal files, your projects , college/school related stuff .
 Initial Setup can be a little cumbersome but in long run it will be beneficial.

    **Installation Guide**  
      - Set Up Arch , Hyprland
